//! Core logic for RepoRoller: orchestrates repository creation from templates.

// The core crate should be able to do the following
//
// - Define a structure with all the user provided information necessary to create a repository (CreateRepoRequest -> rename to CreateRepositoryRequest)
// - Provide a method to create a new repository (create_repository). This method takes the CreateRepositoryRequest structure,
//   validates that all the information is valid (provides errors for each invalid setting) and then creates the repository.
//
// Each GitHub org / personal space may define a set of default settings that apply to each repository being created in
// that space, e.g. naming guidelines or repository rulesets or .... The core crate will read these from a repository in
// that space.
//
// The create_repository method will take the following steps
// - Check that the information provided is valid, return errors for each invalid option
// - Create a new (empty) repository on GitHub with the provided org / personal space as owner and the provided repository
//   name
// - Locally clone the repository, add all the files to the local workspace.
// - Process all the template variables and replace them in the files in the local workspace
// - Create a single commit to the default branch (to be specified by the area settings). This commit should be
//   signed with the app key so that it is clear that the commit was made by the app.
// - Push the changes to the repository. In order to do so we may have to disable (for the app or the repository) rulesets
//   that block direct pushes to the default branch
// - Update the settings in the repository
// - Sign the repository up for the required GitHub apps that the area requires, e.g. all repositories in an area should
//   be signed up for a bot that checks pull requests
// - Trigger potential subsequent processes (defined by webhooks that can be provided). This allows other processes to
//   do work after the repository is created, e.g. creating infrastructure on a SaaS cloud etc.
